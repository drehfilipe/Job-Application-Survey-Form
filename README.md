# Responsive Web Design Projects - Survey Form

## Job application survey

This is my second coding project and part of my portfolio using freeCodeCamp lessons.
Using what I learned from the previous project https://github.com/drehfilipe/Salvador-Dali-Tribute-Page I now have a better understanding on html and css basics. I'm having a lot of fun learning how to code and can't wait for the next challange!
